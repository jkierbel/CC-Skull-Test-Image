CCSkull_Linear709.exr is a half-float file with DWAA compression (l-25), with non-occlusive luminescent pixels, made for testing purposes.

Rec.709/sRGB primaries.
D65 whitepoint.
Linear transfer function.

Max tiplet: 	R: 2095.435	/ G: 368.668	/ B: 156.008
Average: 	R: 0.709	/ G: 0.621	/ B: 0.612
Median:		R: 0.009	/ G: 0.005	/ B: 0.005


References naming:

*FLEB = Filmic Log Encoding Base

Example:
	"CCSkull_01_d-sRGB_t-sRGB_OETF"

	"d" is for Display Device
	"t" is for Transform

So e.g. "CCSkull_01_d-sRGB_t-sRGB_EOTF" is the "CCSkull_Linear709.exr" file, under an sRGB EOTF transform for sRGB displays,

	"CCSkull_05_d-709_t-Bt1886" is the "CCSkull_Linear709.exr" file, under a BT.1886 transform for Rec.709 displays.

And so on.
